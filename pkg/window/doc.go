// Package window implements windowing constructs. In the world of data processing on an unbounded stream, Windowing
// is a concept of grouping data using temporal boundaries. We use event-time to discover temporal boundaries on an
// unbounded, infinite stream and Watermark to ensure the datasets within the boundaries are complete. A reduce function
// can be applied on this group of data.
//
// Windows are of different types, quite popular ones are Fixed windows and Sliding windows. Sessions are managed via
// little less popular windowing strategy called Session windows. Windowing is implemented as a two stage process,
//   - Assign windows - assign the event to a window
//   - Merge windows - group all the events that below to the same window
//
// The two stage approach is required because assignment of windows could happen as elements are streaming in, but merging
// could happen before the data materialization happens. This is important esp. when we handle session windows where a
// new event can change the end time of the window.
//
// For simplicity, we will be truncating the windows' boundaries to the nearest time unit (say, 1 minute windows will
// be truncated to 0th second). Truncating window time to the nearest boundary will help us do mapping with constant time
// without affecting the correctness, except for the very first materialization of result (e.g., we started at 9:00.11
// and the result will be materialized at 9:01.00 and not at 9:01:11).
//
// Windows may be either aligned (e.g., Fixed, Sliding), i.e. applied across all the data for the window of time in
// question, or unaligned, (e.g., Session) i.e. applied across only specific subsets of the data (e.g. per key) for the
// given window of time.
