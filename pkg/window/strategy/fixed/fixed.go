// Package fixed implements Fixed windows. Fixed windows (sometimes called tumbling windows) are
// defined by a static window size, e.g. minutely windows or hourly windows. They are generally aligned, i.e. every
// window applies across all the data for the corresponding period of time.
// Package fixed also maintains the state of active keyed windows in a vertex.
// Keyed AlignedWindower maintains the association between set of keys and an interval window.
// keyed also provides the lifecycle management of an interval window. Watermark is used to trigger the expiration of windows.

// Fixed maintains the state of active windows
// All the operations in Fixed (see window.Windower) order the entries in the ascending order of start time.
// So the earliest window is at the front and the oldest window is at the end.

	// windows are sorted in chronological order with the earliest window at the head of the list.
	// list.List is implemented as a doubly linked list which allows us to traverse the nodes in
	// both the directions.
	// Although the worst case time complexity is O(n), because of the time based ordering and
	// since the elements are rarely out of order, the amortized complexity works out to be closer to O(1)
	// Because most of the keys are expected to be associated with the most recent window, we always start
	// the traversal from the tail of the list for Get and Create Operations. For Remove Operations, since
	// the earlier windows are expected to be closed before the more recent ones, we start the traversal
	// from the Head.
