// Package fixed implements Fixed windows. Fixed windows (sometimes called tumbling windows) are
// defined by a static window size, e.g. minutely windows or hourly windows. They are generally aligned, i.e. every
// window applies across all the data for the corresponding period of time.
// Package fixed also maintains the state of active keyed windows in a vertex.
// Keyed Window maintains the association between set of keys and an interval window.
// keyed also provides the lifecycle management of an interval window. Watermark is used to trigger the expiration of windows.
