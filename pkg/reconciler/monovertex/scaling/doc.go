// Package scaling provides the autoscaling capability for MonoVertex objects.
//
// A workqueue is implemented in this package to watch monovertices in the cluster,
// calculate the desired replica number for each of them periodically, and
// patch the MonoVertex spec.
//
// Function StartWatching() and StopWatching() are also provided in the package,
// so that monovertices can be added into and removed from the workqueue.
