Package isb defines and implements the inter-step buffer and the communication. The inter-step communication is reading from the
previous step (n-1th vertex in the DAG), processing it, conditionally forwarding to zero, one or all the neighboring steps (nth vertices)
and then acknowledging back to the previous step that we are done with processing.
