# Multi-partitioned Edges

To achieve higher throughput(> 10K but < 30K tps), users can create multi-partitioned edges.
Multi-partitioned edges are only supported for pipelines with JetStream as ISB. Please ensure
that the JetStream is provisioned with more nodes to support higher throughput.

Since partitions are owned by the vertex reading the data, to create a multi-partitioned edge
we need to configure the vertex reading the data (to-vertex) to have multiple partitions.

The following code snippet provides an example of how to configure a vertex (in this case, the `cat` vertex) to have multiple partitions, which enables it (`cat` vertex)  to read at a higher throughput.

```yaml
    - name: cat
      partitions: 3
      udf:
        builtin:
          name: cat # A built-in UDF which simply cats the message
```
