# Autoscaling

Numaflow is able to run with both `Horizontal Pod Autoscaling` and `Vertical Pod Autoscaling`.

## Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

`Horizontal Pod Autoscaling` approaches supported in Numaflow include:

- Numaflow Autoscaling
- [Kubernetes HPA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)
- Third Party Autoscaling (such as [KEDA](https://keda.sh/))

### Numaflow Autoscaling

Numaflow provides `0 - N` autoscaling capability out of the box, it's available for all the `UDF`, `Sink` and most of
the [`Source`](../sources/overview.md) vertices (please check each source for more details).

Numaflow autoscaling is enabled by default, there are some parameters can be tuned to achieve better results.

```yaml
apiVersion: numaflow.numaproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: my-pipeline
spec:
  vertices:
    - name: my-vertex
      scale:
        disabled: false # Optional, defaults to false.
        min: 0 # Optional, minimum replicas, defaults to 0.
        max: 20 # Optional, maximum replicas, defaults to 50.
        lookbackSeconds: 120 # Optional, defaults to 120.
        scaleUpCooldownSeconds: 90 # Optional, defaults to 90.
        scaleDownCooldownSeconds: 90 # Optional, defaults to 90.
        zeroReplicaSleepSeconds: 120 # Optional, defaults to 120.
        targetProcessingSeconds: 20 # Optional, defaults to 20.
        targetBufferAvailability: 50 # Optional, defaults to 50.
        replicasPerScale: 2 # Optional, defaults to 2.
```

- `disabled` - Whether to disable Numaflow autoscaling, defaults to `false`.
- `min` - Minimum replicas, valid value could be an integer >= 0. Defaults to `0`, which means it could be scaled down to 0.
- `max` - Maximum replicas, positive integer which should not be less than `min`, defaults to `50`. if `max` and `min`
  are the same, that will be the fixed replica number.
- `lookbackSeconds` - How many seconds to lookback for vertex average processing rate (tps) and pending messages calculation,
  defaults to `120`. Rate and pending messages metrics are critical for autoscaling, you might need to tune this parameter
  a bit to see better results. For example, your data source only have 1 minute data input in every 5 minutes, and you
  don't want the vertices to be scaled down to `0`. In this case, you need to increase `lookbackSeconds` to cover all the
  5 minutes, so that the calculated average rate and pending messages won't be `0` during the silent period, to prevent
  scaling down to 0 from happening.
- `scaleUpCooldownSeconds` - After a scaling operation, how many seconds to wait for the same vertex, if the follow-up
  operation is a scaling up, defaults to `90`. Please make sure that the time is greater that the pod to be `Running` and
  start processing, because the autoscaling algorithm will divide the TPS by the number of pods even if the pod is not `Running`.
- `scaleDownCooldownSeconds` - After a scaling operation, how many seconds to wait for the same vertex, if the follow-up
  operation is a scaling down, defaults to `90`.
- `zeroReplicaSleepSeconds` - How many seconds it will wait after scaling down to `0`, defaults to `120`.
  Numaflow autoscaler periodically scales up a vertex pod to "peek" the incoming data, this is the period of time to wait before peeking.
- `targetProcessingSeconds` - It is used to tune the aggressiveness of autoscaling for source vertices, it measures how
  fast you want the vertex to process all the pending messages, defaults to `20`. It is only effective for the `Source` vertices which
  support autoscaling, typically increasing the value leads to lower processing rate, thus less replicas.
- `targetBufferAvailability` - Targeted buffer availability in percentage, defaults to `50`. It is only effective for `UDF`
  and `Sink` vertices, it determines how aggressive you want to do for autoscaling, increasing the value will bring more replicas.
- `replicasPerScale` - Maximum number of replicas change happens in one scale up or down operation, defaults to `2`. For
  example, if current replica number is 3, the calculated desired replica number is 8; instead of scaling up the vertex to 8, it only does 5.

To disable Numaflow autoscaling, set `disabled: true` as following.

```yaml
apiVersion: numaflow.numaproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: my-pipeline
spec:
  vertices:
    - name: my-vertex
      scale:
        disabled: true
```

**Notes**

Numaflow autoscaling does not apply to reduce vertices, and following source vertices which do not have a way to calculate their pending messages.

- Generator
- HTTP
- Nats

### Kubernetes HPA

[Kubernetes HPA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) is supported in Numaflow for any type of Vertex. To use HPA, remember to point the `scaleTargetRef` to the vertex as below, and disable Numaflow autoscaling in your Pipeline spec.

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-vertex-hpa
spec:
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 3
  metrics:
    - resource:
        name: cpu
        targetAverageUtilization: 50
      type: Resource
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: numaflow.numaproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Vertex
    name: my-vertex
```

With the configuration above, Kubernetes HPA controller will keep the target utilization of the pods of the Vertex at 50%.

Kubernetes HPA autoscaling is useful for those Source vertices not able to count pending messages, such as [HTTP](../sources/http.md).

### Third Party Autoscaling

Third party autoscaling tools like [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) are also supported in Numaflow, which can be used to autoscale any type of vertex with the scalers it supports.

To use KEDA for vertex autoscaling, same as Kubernetes HPA, point the `scaleTargetRef` to your vertex, and disable Numaflow autoscaling in your Pipeline spec.

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: my-keda-scaler
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: numaflow.numaproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Vertex
    name: my-vertex
  ... ...
```

## Vertical Pod Autoscaling

`Vertical Pod Autoscaling` can be achieved by setting the `targetRef` to `Vertex` objects as following.

```yaml
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: numaflow.numaproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Vertex
    name: my-vertex
```
