# Sinks

The Sink serves as the endpoint for processed data that has been outputted from the platform,
which is then sent to an external system or application. The purpose of the Sink is to deliver 
the processed data to its ultimate destination, such as a database, data warehouse, visualization 
tool, or alerting system. It's the opposite of the Source vertex, which receives input data into the platform.
Sink vertex may require transformation or formatting of data prior to sending it to the target system. Depending on the 
target system's needs, this transformation can be simple or complex.

A pipeline can have many Sink vertices, unlike the Source vertex.

Numaflow currently supports the following Sinks

* [Kafka](./kafka.md)
* [Log](./log.md)
* [Black Hole](./blackhole.md)
* [User-defined Sink](./user-defined-sinks.md)

A user-defined sink is a custom Sink that a user can write using Numaflow SDK when 
the user needs to output the processed data to a system or using a certain transformation that is not 
supported by the platform's built-in sinks. As an example, once we have processed the input messages, 
we can use Elasticsearch as a user-defined sink to store the processed data and enable search and 
analysis on the data.

## Fallback Sink (DLQ)

There is an explicit DLQ support for sinks using a concept called [fallback sink](fallback.md). For the rest of vertices,
if you need DLQ, please use [conditional-forwarding](../reference/conditional-forwarding.md).
Sink cannot not do conditional-forwarding since it is a terminal state and hence we have explicit fallback option.
