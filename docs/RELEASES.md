# Releases

You can find the most recent version under [Github Releases](https://github.com/numaproj/numaflow/releases).

## Versioning

Versions are expressed as `vx.y.z` (for example, `v0.5.3`), where `x` is the major version, `y` is the minor version, and `z` is the patch version, following Semantic Versioning terminology.

NumaFlow does not use Semantic Versioning. Minor versions may contain breaking changes. Patch versions only contain bug fixes and minor features.

There's a `stable` tag, pointing to a latest stable release, usually it is the latest patch version.

## Release Cycle

TBD as NumaFlow is under active development.
