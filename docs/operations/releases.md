# Releases

You can find the most recent version under [Github Releases](https://github.com/numaproj/numaflow/releases).

## Versioning

Versions are expressed as `vx.y.z` (for example, `v0.5.3`), where `x` is the major version, `y` is the minor version, and `z` is the patch version, following Semantic Versioning terminology.

Numaflow does not use Semantic Versioning. Minor versions may contain breaking changes. Patch versions only contain bug fixes and minor features.

There's a `stable` tag, pointing to a latest stable release, usually it is the latest patch version.

## Release Cycle

TBD as Numaflow is under active development.

## Nightly Build

If you want to try out the new features on `main` branch, Numaflow provides nightly build images from `main`, the images are available in the format of `quay.io/numaproj/numaflow:nightly-yyyyMMdd`.

Nightly build images expire in 30 days.
