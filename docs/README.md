# NumaFlow

NumaFlow is a Kubernetes-native platform for running massive parallel data processing and streaming jobs. A NumaFlow Pipeline is implemented as a Kubernetes custom resource, and consists of one or more source, data processing, and sink vertices.

## Key Features

- Kubernetes-native: If you know Kubernetes, you already know 90% of what you need to use NumaFlow.
- Language agnostic: Use your favorite programming language.
- Exactly-Once semantics: No input element is duplicated or lost even as pods are rescheduled or restarted.

## Getting Started

For set-up information and running your first NumaFlow pipeline, please see our [getting started guide](QUICK_START.md).
