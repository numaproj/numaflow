    # The scopes field controls which authentication scopes to examine during rbac enforcement.
    # We can have multiple scopes, and the first scope that matches with the policy will be used.
    # The default value is "groups", which means that the groups field of the user's token will be examined
    # The other possible value is "email", which means that the email field of the user's token will be examined
    # It can be provided as a comma-separated list, e.g "groups,email,username"
