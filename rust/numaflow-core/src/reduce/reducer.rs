//! ## Error Handling
//! Errors are propagated from the reduce tasks to the AlignedReduceActor through the error_tx channel.
//! AlignedReduceActor will cancel the token to signal the upstream to stop sending new messages and
//! exit with error. This is possible because the streaming reader is awaiting on the cancellation token
//! (read) while the write/cancel of the cancellation token is done by the Reduce Actor.
