//! The [Watermark] is propagated across all Vertices from the [crate::source] all the way to
//! the [crate::sink]. The watermark is generated at the [crate::source] based
//! on the event-time, and if it is missing, it will be the ingestion time (the time the data was
//! inserted into the pipeline). Once the watermark is created, it just flows through the subsequent
//! vertices of the pipeline.
//! Every vertex (Source, UDFs, Sink) should implement two interfaces
//!   - Publish Watermark - this will be per unit per-vertex information
//!   - Fetch Watermark - this will be the merged WM of the vertex across all units
//!
//! ## Publish Watermark
//! Publish publishes the watermark of the [processor] of the vertex, always the smallest watermark
//! is published (WM < the oldest message still being processed). We cannot measure the WM of the vertex
//! by looking at the WM of a [processor] of the vertex but by looking into all the WMs published
//! by all the [processor] in that vertex.
//!
//! ## Fetch Watermark
//! Fetch at vertex Vn will fetch the watermarks of all the [processor] of the vertex Vn-1. Fetch
//! happens for every message (looked up using offset) read from the stream (source or isb). We cannot
//! measure the WM of the vertex by looking at the WM of a single [processor] of the vertex but by looking
//! into all the WMs published by all the [processor] in that vertex. The vertex Vn to determine the
//! watermark of an offset will have to query the watermarks of each [processor] of the vertex Vn-1. The
//! lowest watermark among all the [processor] will be set as the watermark of that offset.
