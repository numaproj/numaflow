Once all regular containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy \"Always\" will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and is often referred to as a \"sidecar\" container.

Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed.
